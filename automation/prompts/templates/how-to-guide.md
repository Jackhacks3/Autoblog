   - Required tools or software
   - Prior knowledge assumed
   - Environment setup needed

3. **Step-by-Step Instructions** (5-10 steps)
   - Each step should be a clear, actionable task
   - Include code snippets or configuration examples
   - Add screenshots descriptions where helpful
   - Explain the "why" behind each step

4. **Pro Tips Section**

### Formatting Requirements
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Include code blocks with proper syntax highlighting
- Add "Note:" or "Warning:" callouts for important information
- Use screenshots/diagrams placeholders: `[Screenshot: description]`

## Tone Adjustments
- More hands-on and instructional than thought leadership
- Use second person ("you will...", "your configuration...")
- Be specific and precise with technical details
- Include time estimates for steps when relevant

## Word Count
1,500-2,500 words (longer for complex topics)

## Example Topics
- "How to Integrate Claude API into Your Node.js Application"
- "Setting Up Automated Content Workflows with n8n"
