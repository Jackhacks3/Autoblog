# DALL-E 3 Image Generation Guidelines

Generate professional blog header images for AUTOBLOG articles. Images should be visually striking, thematically relevant, and suitable for a technology/consulting blog.

## Base Prompt Structure

```
Professional blog header image for an article about [TOPIC].

Style: Modern, clean, minimalist corporate aesthetic with depth and dimension.
Color palette: Professional blues (#0ea5e9, #0284c7), teals (#14b8a6), and clean whites.
Composition: Balanced asymmetric layout with clear focal point and negative space.
Mood: Innovative, forward-thinking, trustworthy.
Quality: Photorealistic rendering, high resolution, suitable for web headers.
```

## Content Pillar Variations

### AI & Automation
Visual elements to incorporate:
- Abstract neural network visualizations with glowing nodes
- Flowing data streams and particle effects
- Interconnected geometric patterns
- Circuit-inspired backgrounds with soft gradients
- Robotic/automated process metaphors (gears, pathways)

Example prompt addition:
```
Elements: Abstract neural network with luminous blue nodes connected by flowing data streams.
Background: Subtle grid pattern fading into depth. Floating geometric shapes suggesting computation.
```

### Digital Assets
Visual elements to incorporate:
- Blockchain hexagonal patterns
- Digital-to-physical asset bridging concepts
- Secure vault or ledger imagery
- Token/coin abstractions (geometric, not literal currency)
- Network connectivity visualizations

Example prompt addition:
```
Elements: Interlocking hexagonal blockchain pattern with golden accent highlights.
Background: Deep blue gradient with digital grid. Floating asset icons represented as geometric shapes.
```

### Consulting Insights
Visual elements to incorporate:
- Strategic roadmap visualizations
- Growth and transformation metaphors
- Leadership and vision concepts (horizon, pathways)
- Chart/data visualization abstractions
- Collaborative network patterns

Example prompt addition:
```
Elements: Abstract strategic roadmap with ascending pathways and milestone markers.
Background: Gradient from deep navy to lighter horizon. Subtle chart elements suggesting data-driven decisions.
```

### Industry News
Visual elements to incorporate:
- Global connectivity and world networks
- Breaking/emerging concept visuals
- Technology evolution timelines
- Innovation and disruption metaphors
- Dynamic, energetic compositions

Example prompt addition:
```
Elements: Global network visualization with pulsing connection points.
Background: Dynamic gradient suggesting movement and change. Abstract news/update iconography.
```

## Technical Specifications

- **Size**: 1792x1024 (16:9 aspect ratio for blog headers)
- **Quality**: Standard (use HD for featured/premium content)
- **Style**: Natural (more photorealistic) or Vivid (more stylized) based on content
- **Format**: PNG output

## Absolute Restrictions

These elements must NEVER appear in generated images:

- ❌ Text, words, letters, or numbers
- ❌ Logos or brand marks
- ❌ Human faces or recognizable people
- ❌ Hands or fingers (often render poorly)
- ❌ Specific brand products or devices
- ❌ Cluttered or busy compositions
- ❌ Dark, gloomy, or negative imagery
- ❌ Clichéd stock photo concepts
- ❌ Religious or political symbols
- ❌ Violence or controversial imagery

## Alt Text Generation

For each image, generate SEO-friendly alt text following this pattern:

```
[Primary visual element] representing [topic concept] with [color/style description]
```

Examples:
- "Abstract neural network visualization representing AI automation with blue luminous nodes"
- "Blockchain hexagonal pattern representing digital asset tokenization with teal gradients"
- "Strategic roadmap visualization representing enterprise transformation with ascending pathways"

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing an image prompt, verify:

- [ ] Prompt describes a single, clear focal concept
- [ ] Color palette is specified and brand-appropriate
- [ ] No prohibited elements are requested
- [ ] Composition guidance is included
- [ ] Mood/atmosphere is defined
- [ ] Technical specs match requirements
